# FillingGibe
Repository of codes developed for the paper "When timing matters - misdesigned dam filling impacts hydropower sustainability"

This code repository contains the the following scripts (along with the data and additional functions necessary to run them):

**- script_reconstr_historical_filling.m**: Matlab script used to reconstruct Gibe III historical filling strategy, corresponding to Fig.2 in the manuscript   

**- script_harmonical_trends.m**: Matlab script employed to reconstruct harmonical trends from cumulated precipitation, corresponding to Fig.3a in the manuscript

**- script_optimal_filling_strategy.m**: Matlab script to run the filling policy optimisation in demo mode, powered by Matlab built-in genetic multi-objective optimiser gamultiobj, instead of BorgMOEA used to produce results in the manuscript.

**- script_compute_indicators_timing.m**: Matlab script for computing indicators of alternative filling timings, and generating Figures 3b and Supplementary Figure 6.
